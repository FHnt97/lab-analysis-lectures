After watching the video...
- What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?
The visuals where very good, good colour skeme and clear graphics. 
The cross graohic with the four axis (Actions, idears, rational, emotional) was one of the graphics that best caught my attention. Its was colour divided, very interesting and packed with informaiotion that was easy to extract. 
I also enjoyed the conclusion of how one can set the mood of a presentaiton with colour. I will keep it in mind for future presentaitons!


- What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across?
The speech is great, entretaining, funny, captivating. I'm pretty sure this is one of my favourite non science related TedTalks.
He got his point across very well, presenting his deliverables through great graphics, with highlight in those results he wanted to emphasize. 


- Was the presentation about a trascendental topic? 
It's not the most significant and transcendental topic, as it talks about how to present a topic on stage, something that may be useful only to those who do presentations (students, teachers, businesspeople).
Overall, however, the topic is super interesting as we all know TedTalks and it would be a dream for many to do one. The insights are useful and can be aplied to a wide range of real life situations. 


Did it keep you glued to the screen?
Yes, the graphics were great, colourful and super easy to understand. The speaker was funny and interactive. Great mood through the use of his own analytical results and making it obvious.

- Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?

He could have added a bit of detail as on how he carried out his researhc, as this would have been useful for us in the course. However, I fully understand that he had a strict time limit and that the method allways falls second after the presentaiton of the results and the project.
